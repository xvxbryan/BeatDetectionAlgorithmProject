This project was created for my Computer Organization class.
The purpose of the project was to create a parallelized version of the beat detection algorithm created by Marco Ziccardi.
The StdAudio.java file was provided to us by our professor, who just so happened to have exactly what we needed to get the frequencies from a .wav file and was kind enough to give it to us.
The owner of that code is Trevor Cickovski.
The bpm.c file has the regular version of the algorithm.
The gpubpm.cu file has the parallelized version of the algorithm.
